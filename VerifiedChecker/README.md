## Lean 4 CPOG Proof Checker
### Building

To build the checker, you need to have Lean 4 installed.
It is easiest to use [elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan), the Lean version manager,
as described in 'Basic setup' [here](https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/setup.html#basic-setup).
Once `elan` is ready, run `lake build` in this directory.

### Running

Once built, the checker binary can be found under `.lake/build/bin/checker`.
You can also run it using `lake exe checker`.
