## Lean 4 CPOG Proof Checker
### Building

To build the checker, you need to have Lean 4 installed. It is easiest to use [elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan), the Lean version manager, as described in 'Basic setup' [here](https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/setup.html#basic-setup). Once `elan` is ready, run `lake build` in this directory.

### Running

Once built, the checker binary can be found under `./build/bin/checker`.
