## CPOG Knowledge Compiler Certifier

This repository contains a set of tools for certifying results from the D4 knowledge
compiler.  It is based on the **CPOG** verification framework.  A CPOG file
encodes both a representation of a Boolean formula as a
**partitioned-operation graph** (POG), and a proof that this POG is
logically equivalent to the input formula

# Installation:

Running the toolchain using prototype (unverified) tools requires the following:

* A C and C++ compiler
* A python3 interpreter
* An installed version of the [D4 knowledge compiler](https://github.com/crillab/d4)
* An installed version of the [CaDiCal SAT solver](https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical)
* An installed version of the [Drat-trim proof checker](https://github.com/marijnheule/drat-trim)

In addition, running the toolchain using formally verified tools requires the following:

* An installed version of the Lean [Elan version manager](https://github.com/leanprover/elan)

# Directories

* **VerifiedChecker:**
    Code for the verified checker and counter
* **benchmarks:**
    A sample set of benchmarks from the 2022 standard and weighted model counting competitions
